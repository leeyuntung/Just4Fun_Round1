## Smart Bin 2.0: AI-Driven Waste Sorting for a Greener Future!
### Project Overview
This project brings a smart solution to waste sorting. It's an AI-powered waste bin that sorts items right at the moment they're disposed of, ensuring they’re correctly categorized. By using AI vision, the bin identifies what you're throwing away—plastic, metal, glass, paper—and sorts it for recycling. To make it even better, we’ve included a rewards system that encourages everyone to do their part by giving them points for correctly disposing of waste. The system is also designed to be affordable and can be used in homes, offices, or public spaces.

### Key Features
- AI Sorting: The bin uses AI to recognize and sort waste into categories like plastic, metal, paper, and glass, as you throw it in.
- Rewards for Recycling: You earn points when you dispose of waste correctly—encouraging everyone to make better waste habits.
- Affordable & Scalable: Whether for a small home or a public space, the smart bin is cost-effective and easy to scale.
